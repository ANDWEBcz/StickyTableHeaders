StickyTableHeaders
==================
So what's it good for?


Browser Support
---------------
The plugin has been tested in:
-   Chrome 14
-   Firefox 7
-   Internet Explorer 9
-   Internet Explorer 8

NOTE: It does not currently work in Internet Explorer 7.


Future Work
-----------
Writing a better readme

I am considering implementing support for making the entire `<thead>` section sticky.


Known Issues
------------
-   You need to set the padding of the `<th>`s explicitly in the css in order to make the plugin work in Internet Explorer.
-   No IE7 support
